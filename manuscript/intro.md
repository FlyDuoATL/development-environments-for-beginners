## About the book
If you're not sure how to choose between programming in ruby, python, or javascript, this guide will get you familiar with the tools, syntax, and workflow associated with each language.

By comparing ruby, python, and javascript development environments you'll get a strong sense of which language best fits your style. 

Maybe you'll learn that you want to work in all three, or two out of three. Whatever happens, you'll be able to use this guide as a reference if you need help remembering how to set up a development environment for any one of these three languages.

### Main concepts you'll learn:
- command-line tools
- virtual machines
- text editors
- version control
- package managers
- documentation
- testing
- language basics
- intro to web frameworks
