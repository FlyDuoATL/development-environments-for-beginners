# Javascript

Javascript is a ubiquitous language. It's getting first class support in various operating sytems, you can use it on the server with node.js, and developing javascript applications that are largely front-end code is becoming a popular and pragmatic practice.

We'll cover javascript on the server using node.js, and briefly cover javascript in the browser.

Javascript development tools have recently seen a big burst of growth thanks to node.js.

## Installing node.js

I recommend using a tool called `nvm` for installing node.js if you're on mac or linux.

If you're on Windows, install node.js using the .msi package on the nodejs.org downloads page: [http://nodejs.org/downloads](http://nodejs.org/downloads).

**nvm:** [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

**Javascript in the browser:**

You don't need to install anything for javascript in the browser. The browser takes care of that for you. I recommend using Chrome for the examples in this book. Firefox is also excellent, and if you choose to use it, there will be just slight differences between the developer tools compared to Chrome.



## Package manager: npm
When you install node.js, you get npm.

**npm:** [http://npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org)

You may also want to use bower or component, two package managers that specifically target client-side code. Remember that javascript packages distributed are not limited to node.js, and can also be used in the browser in many cases.



## Testing: tape
For testing, we'll use a library named tape.
