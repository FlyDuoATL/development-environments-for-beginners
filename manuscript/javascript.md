# Javascript

In the javascript section, we will cover javascript on the server using node.js, and briefly cover javascript in the browser.

### node.js documentation:

## Installing node.js: nvm

I recommend using a tool called `nvm` for installing node.js.

nvm: [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Package manager: npm
When you install node.js, you get npm.
http://npmjs.org

You may also want to use bower or component, two package managers that specifically target client-side code. Remember that javascript packages distributed are not limited to node.js, and can also be used in the browser in many cases.

## Testing: tape
For testing, we'll use a library named tape: [https://github.com/substack/tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).

## Web framework: express
Express is a small web framework for node.js, originally inspired by sinatra. express: [http://expressjs.com/](http://expressjs.com/)
