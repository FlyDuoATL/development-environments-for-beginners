# Ruby

Ruby is a pleasant language that gets about as close to the English language as possible.

It's popular in large part because of the web development framework Ruby on Rails.

## Language website

## Vagrant

Let's create a vagrant machine in your ruby DevEnvs folder:

~~~~~~~~
cd ~/DevEnvs/ruby
~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~
vagrant init
~~~~~~~~

## Installing ruby
rbenv / ruby-build / rbenv-vars


We'll be using rbenv to install ruby: [https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

We'll also need ruby-build.

## Package manager: rubygems

### Use bundler
http://bundler.io/

## Automating repetitive tasks

For automating tasks in ruby development, use [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/).

### Install

First, install the rake gem:

~~~~~~~~
gem install rake
~~~~~~~~

Next, you'll create a Rakefile in your project.

Learn more about rake by reading the [project documentation](http://rake.rubyforge.org/).

We'll go in-depth with rake in the extended ruby example later in the chapter.

## Testing: minitest
https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest

## Language basics

### variables

Create a variable like this:

~~~~~~~~
a = 1
~~~~~~~~

### numbers

In ruby there are integers and floats. An integer is a whole number, a float is a decimal.

Integers:

~~~~~~~~
1
100
223239
~~~~~~~~

Floats:

~~~~~~~~
1.0
5.132
3.14
~~~~~~~~

### string

A string is a _string of characters_ wrapped in single or double quotes:

~~~~~~~~
"this is a string"
'this is also a string'
~~~~~~~~

When using double quotes, you can use string interpolation to insert the values of variables into a string:

~~~~~~~~
food = 'pizza'
sentence = "#{food} is yummy."
~~~~~~~~

The `sentence` variable will return this: `pizza is yummy`.


### array

An array is like a list of values. You can put anything in an array: strings, numbers, other arrays, hashes, etc.

They look like this:

~~~~~~~~
things = ['pizza is great.', 30, ['yep', 'ok']]
~~~~~~~~

#### Accessing values in an array:

You can access values in an array by typing the variable name followed by square brackets and a number that represents the value you'd like to access.

Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first item is represented by a zero:

~~~~~~~~
things[0]
~~~~~~~~

This returns `'pizza is great'`.

To get at nested arrays, you add another set of square brackets, like this:

~~~~~~~~
things[2][1]
~~~~~~~~

The above statement returns `'ok'`.


### hash

A hash is much like an array, except instead of the values being indexed by numbers, they have names.

A simple hash looks like this:

~~~~~~~~
pizza = { :tastes => 'really good', :slices_i_can_eat => 100 }
~~~~~~~~

There's also an alternate, more concise syntax for creating a hash that looks like this:

~~~~~~~~
pizza = { tastes: 'really good', slices_i_can_eat: 100 }
~~~~~~~~

#### Accessing hash values

Accessing values in a hash looks similar to arrays:

~~~~~~~~
pizza[:tastes]
~~~~~~~~

The above statement returns `'really good'`.

~~~~~~~~
pizza[:slices_i_can_eat]
~~~~~~~~

The above statement returns `100`. That's a lot of slices of pizza.

### function

A function definition is super simple:

~~~~~~~~
def eat(food)
  return "I ate #{food}."
end
~~~~~~~~

`def` indicates that we're about to define a function.

`eat` is the name of the function.

In parentheses, we indicate that one argument is expected, `food`.

This line: `return "I ate #{food}."` indicates that `"I ate #{food}."` will be returned when the function is called.

We can actually rewrite that line to exclude the `return` keyword. The last statement in a function will get returned automatically. Since we only have one line in this function we don't need `return'.

#### Calling a function

Now that the function is defined, you can call it like this:

~~~~~~~~
eat('pizza')
~~~~~~~~

That statement will return: `'I ate pizza.'`.

The parenthese are optional, so we can write the function call like this:

~~~~~~~~
eat 'pizza' 
~~~~~~~~

### class

Define a class in ruby like this:

~~~~~~~~
class Meal
  # here we'll define methods on the class
end
~~~~~~~~

### class methods

Class methods are basically functions that exist inside of a class namespace.

~~~~~~~~
class Meal

  def initialize(food)
    @food = food
  end
  
  def prepare
    @prepared = true
    "#{@food} is ready!"
  end

  def eat
    if @prepared == true
      "dang, that #{@food} sure was good."
    else
      "relax, the #{@food} isn't prepared yet."
    end
  end

end
~~~~~~~~

### class instance

Now, to use our Meal class and call the `prepare` and `eat` methods, we do this:

~~~~~~~~
dinner = Meal.new 'pizza'
~~~~~~~~

We can call a method by typing the name of the class instance, followed by a period and the name of the method. Let's try out the `eat` method:

~~~~~~~~
dinner.eat
~~~~~~~~

That's return this string: `"relax, the pizza isn't prepared yet."`.

So let's `prepare` the dinner:

~~~~~~~~
dinner.prepare
~~~~~~~~

That'll return this string: `"pizza is ready!"`.

Now run `dinner.eat` and we'll see this string: `"dang, that pizza sure was good."`.


### importing/requiring code

We can require the functionality of ruby gems and code from other files by using the `require` statement, typically at the top of the file. An example of requiring the sinatra gem:

~~~~~~~~
require 'sinatra'
~~~~~~~~

## Web framework: sinatra
Project website: [http://www.sinatrarb.com](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

### Install

Navigate to your ruby projects folder:

~~~~~~~~
cd ~/DevEnvs/ruby
~~~~~~~~

Create a folder named hello-sinatra and navigate into it:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir hello-sinatra && cd hello-sinatra
~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~
gem install sinatra
~~~~~~~~

### Simple example

Inside your hello-sinatra directory, create a file named app.rb:

~~~~~~~~
touch app.rb
~~~~~~~~

Here's a simple example of a sinatra app:

~~~~~~~~
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'pizza is awesome'
end
~~~~~~~~

Type that code into your app.rb file.

Now you can run your app with this command:

~~~~~~~~
ruby app.rb
~~~~~~~~

Let's go through this app line by line:

**Import the sinatra functionality into our app:**

~~~~~~~~
require 'sinatra'
~~~~~~~~

**Call `get`, to respond to requests for the root url:**

~~~~~~~~
get '/' do
~~~~~~~~

**Respond to requests with some text:**

~~~~~~~~
  'pizza is awesome'
~~~~~~~~

**Close the `get` block:**

~~~~~~~~
end
~~~~~~~~


### Extended example

Let's make a small website with [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) to explore how it works.

In this example our site will do three things:  
- serve html at the root route from a view that has a list of posts
- serve html for a single post at `/post/:id`
- serve json at `/api/posts` that has a list of posts

We won't be using a database for this example, but instead will use a json file with a list of posts.

To get started, create and change directory into a new project folder.

```
mkdir sinatra-example
cd sinatra-example
```

We'll be using sinatra and will utilize the default template language, erb. Let's install sinatra by creating a Gemfile:

```
touch Gemfile
```

Add the sinatra gem to the Gemfile:

```
gem 'sinatra'
```

Now run bundle to install sinatra:

```
bundle
```

We will use [shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun "shotgun") to run the app â€“ shotgun will automatically restart the server each time you edit a file in the project.

Install shotgun:

```
gem install shotgun
```

To run the sinatra app you'll use this command:

```
shotgun app.rb
```

Create a file named posts.json with the following json:

```
[
{
  "title": "This is the first post",
  "slug": "first-post",
  "content": "The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome. The pizza is awesome."
},
{
  "title": "Another post that you might like",
  "slug": "second-post",
  "content": "Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great. Eating pizza is great."
},
{
  "title": "The third and last post",
  "slug": "third-post",
  "content": "The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out. The pizza always runs out."
}
]
```

Now create the app.rb file:

```
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

before do
  @title = 'Extended Sinatra example'
  @posts = JSON.parse( IO.read('posts.json') )
end

get '/' do
  erb :index
end

get '/post/:slug' do
  @posts.each do |post| 
    if post['slug'] == params[:slug] 
      @post = post
    end
  end
  erb :post
end

get '/api/posts' do
  data = { 
    meta: { name: @title },
    posts: @posts
  }
  data.to_json
end
```

Let's break down this example code chunk by chunk:

Require the necessary ruby libraries:

```
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'
```


Create global variables that are available to our views using the before method, which runs before a request is processed:

```
before do
  @title = 'Extended Sinatra example'
  @posts = JSON.parse( IO.read('posts.json') )
end
```

Serve the index.erb view on the root url with the following code block. note that an erb view is rendered using the `erb` method, and you don't have to include the .erb file suffix. Sinatra automatically looks in a folder named views, so you only have to pass the file name:

```
get '/' do
  erb :index
end
```

The following code block listens for requests for a specific blog post. We iterate through each of the items in our posts array, and if the slug that's passed in the url matches a slug in the posts array, that post is set to a global `@post` variable that's available in our post view.

```
get '/post/:slug' do
  @posts.each do |post| 
    if post['slug'] == params[:slug] 
      @post = post
    end
  end
  erb :post
end
```

The following is a simple example of exposing a simple json feed of the posts:

```
get '/api/posts' do
  data = { 
    meta: { name: @title },
    posts: @posts
  }
  data.to_json
end
```


Next, we'll need the erb views for rendering html.

Let's make a views folder for all the views to live in:

```
mkdir views
```

And create all the view files that we need:

```
touch views/layout.erb views/index.erb views/post.erb
```

Add this content to the layout.erb file:

```

```

Add this content to the footer.ejs file:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title><%= @title %></title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<header>
  <div class="container">
    <h1><a href="/"><%= @title %></a></h1>
  </div>
</header>

<main role="main">
  <div class="container">
    <%= yield %>
  </main>
</div>

<footer>
  <div class="container">
    <p>Posts are also available via json at <a href="/api/posts">/api/posts</a>/
  </div>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
```

Add this content to the index.erb file:

```
<% for @post in @posts %>
  <h3>
    <a href="/post/<%= @post['slug'] %>">
      <%= @post['title'] %>
    </a>
  </h3>
  <div><%= @post['content'] %></div>
<% end %>
```

Add this content to the post.erb file:

```
<h3><%= @post['title'] %></h3>
<div><%= @post['content'] %></div>
```

Let's add some css styling so this looks a little more readable.

First create the public folder and the styles.css file:

```
mkdir public
touch public/styles.css
```

Now add this content to the styles.css file:

```
body {
  font: 16px/1.5 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #787876;
}

h1, h3 {
  font-weight: 300;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #EA6045;
}

a:hover {
  color: #2F3440;
}

.container {
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0px auto;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 30px;
  border-top: 1px solid #efefef;
  padding-top: 20px;
  font-style: italic;
}

@media (min-width: 600px){
  .container {
    width: 60%;
  }
}
```

You should now be able to navigate the home page, three blog post pages, and the posts json feed. Run the project with the nodemon command:

```
shotgun app.rb
```
