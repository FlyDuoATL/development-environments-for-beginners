# Text editors

## Sublime Text Editor

Sublime is a popular text editor with versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

You can download an evaluation copy for free, and pay for a license whenever you're ready.

In this book we'll be using version 2 of Sublime, in future updates to the book we'll switch to version 3.
