# Git: it's like File>Save only collaborative

Seriously. You know how important it is to save your work. We've all been beaten into a sad sack of anger and dissapointment when we've lost our work.

Consider git to be the equivalent of File>Save that keeps track of every version of your work, and allows you to share those versions with other people and collaborate in a way that won't have you overwriting each other's changes.

Git is version control software.

There are many alternatives to git, but it has become a standard for developers in large part because of github.com, a service for hosting code using git.
