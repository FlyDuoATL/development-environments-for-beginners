# What is a development environment?

### Wait, what is this development environment thing?

Think of it like a workshop.

Except your workshop is pretty much all inside your computer.

A development environment is a set of tools installed on your computer that consist of everything you need to work on a project.

A development environment is also considered a stage in the workflow, or release cycle, of a project.

### Other stages can include:
- testing
- staging
- production

There can be other stages, too, depending on the complexity of the project and the requirements you must meet for quality assurance and user testing.
