# Get started

To get ready for working through the upcoming examples, we'll set up a few things.

## Make sure all the software we installed is running

### vagrant

### git

### sublime

## Create a folder for working through examples

Let's make a folder named DevEnvs in your home directory.

On Macs the home directory is:

~~~~~~~~
/Users/YOUR-USERNAME
~~~~~~~~

On Windows:

~~~~~~~~
%userprofile%
~~~~~~~~

On Linux:

~~~~~~~~
/home/YOUR-USERNAME
~~~~~~~~

On Mac, Linux, and recent versions of Windows (in the Powershell terminal / in Windows 7+), there's a useful alias for a user's home directory, the tilde:

~~~~~~~~
~
~~~~~~~~

So, you can run a command like `cd ~`, and that'll take you to your home directory.

Once you've navigated to your home folder, create the DevEnvs folder:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir DevEnvs
~~~~~~~~

Change directory into DevEnvs, then create directories for javascript, ruby, and python:

~~~~~~~~
cd DevEnvs
mkdir javascript ruby python
~~~~~~~~

We'll use these directories to store the examples we work through later in the book.
